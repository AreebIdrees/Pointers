# Pointers
Pointers serve as a way to access and manipulate data stored in memory. They are often used for various purposes, including dynamic memory allocation, passing parameters to functions by reference, and implementing data structures like linked lists and trees.

Theory
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. When you manipulate a pointer, you are essentially working with the memory location of the data it points to. Pointers are commonly used in low-level languages like C and C++ but are also present in other languages, such as Python and Java, through different mechanisms.
